# Data Files Overview

There are currently 23 data files.

These data files are the test problem sets IV to XIII and A to C in Table 1 of J.E. Beasley's "An algorithm for solving large capacitated warehouse location problems" European Journal of Operational Research 33 (1988) 314-325.

These test problems essentially (but see Appendix in the above paper) include the standard Akinc and Khumawala test problems for the capacitated warehouse location problem.

## Relationship Between Test Problem Set and Files

| Problem Set | Files               |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| VII         | cap71, ..., cap74   |
| VIII        | cap81, ..., cap84   |
| IX          | cap91, ..., cap94   |
| X           | cap101, ..., cap104 |
| XIII        | cap131, ..., cap134 |
| A           | capa                |
| B           | capb                |
| C           | capc                |

## Data Files Format

The format of these data files is:

1. **Header:**

   - Number of potential warehouse locations (m)
   - Number of customers (n)

2. **Warehouse Information:**
   For each potential warehouse location \(i\) (i=1,...,m):

   - Capacity
   - Fixed cost

3. **Customer Information:**
   For each customer \(j\) (j=1,...,n):
   - Demand
   - Cost of allocating all of the demand of \(j\) to warehouse \(i\) (i=1,...,m)

For files capa, capb, and capc (which are large files) in order to save file space, a single data file is used to represent four test problems. The word 'capacity' in these files should be replaced by the appropriate numeric value from Table 1 of the above paper in order to generate each of the four problems in problem sets A, B, and C.

## Optimal Solutions

The value of the optimal solution for each of these data files is given in the file `capopt`.

## File Sizes

- The largest file is `capc` of size 1300Kb (approximately).
- The entire set of files is of size 5000Kb (approximately).

## Additional Information

A full listing of the problem areas covered by OR-library can be found in the file `info`.

### Note

I added the optimal solutions to this package. For each problem, we have an optimal solution in the corresponding `.opt` file as follows: For each city (in order of appearance in the problem file) we denoted the facility it is connected to in the optimal solution.

The data file `cap71.txt` is structured according to a specific format for the capacitated facility location problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the file content based on the format you provided:

# File Example Format Breakdown

1. **First Line:**

   - Number of potential warehouse locations (m)
   - Number of customers (n)

2. **Next `m` Lines (one for each warehouse location):**

   - Capacity of the warehouse
   - Fixed cost of opening the warehouse

3. **Remaining Lines (one set of `m` values for each customer, repeated `n` times):**
   - For each customer:
     - Demand of the customer
     - Cost of allocating all of the demand of the customer to each warehouse (one cost per warehouse)

### Content of `cap71.txt`

#### First Line

```plaintext
16 50
```

- **Number of warehouse locations (m):** 16
- **Number of customers (n):** 50

#### Next 16 Lines (Warehouse Data)

Each line contains two values: capacity and fixed cost for each warehouse.

```plaintext
58268 7500.
58268 7500.
58268 7500.

58268 7500.
58268 7500.
58268 7500.
```

- **Capacity of each warehouse:** 58268 (for all warehouses)
- **Fixed cost for each warehouse:** Mostly 7500, except for one warehouse which has a fixed cost of 0.

#### Remaining Lines (Customer Data)

Each block of lines represents the data for a single customer. Each customer block contains 16 values, one for each warehouse, indicating the cost to allocate the customer's demand to that warehouse.

- **First value in each block:** Demand of the customer.
- **Following 16 values:** Cost of allocating all demand of the customer to each warehouse.
